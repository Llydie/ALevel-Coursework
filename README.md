# ALevel-Coursework
Shortest Path finder for use with board game maps.\
This project was written for my A Level CW, when I had very little experience in coding and so was my first big Object-Oriented Project written entirely from scratch. It uses 
Djikstra's algorithm to work out the shortest route between two points on a map (represented as a graph). It allows any map to be uploaded provided it is in the correct JSON format.
The graph was implemented using a min-heap priority queue for a faster implementation of Djikstra's.
